# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      This proposal is open for discussion and voting. If you are an [eligible voter](%{site_url}/users/) on this project (and not the proposer), you may cast your vote on whether or not it is accepted.

      ## How to vote
      Vote by entering one of the following symbols in a comment on this pull request. Only your last vote will be counted, and you may change your vote at any time until the change is accepted or closed.

      |vote|symbol|type this|points|
      |--|--|--|--|
      |Yes|:white_check_mark:|`:white_check_mark:`|%{yes_weight}|
      |No|:negative_squared_cross_mark:|`:negative_squared_cross_mark:`|%{no_weight}|

      |Block|:no_entry_sign:|`:no_entry_sign:`|%{block_weight}|

      Proposals will be accepted and merged once they have a total of %{pass_threshold} points when all votes are counted. Votes will be open for a minimum of %{min_age} days, but will be closed if the proposal is not accepted after %{max_age}.

      Votes are counted [automatically here](%{site_url}/proposals/%{proposal_number}), and results are set in the merge status checks below.
